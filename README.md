# Bound States of Ultra Cold Neutron in Uniform Gravitational Potential with Parabolic Boundaries

This repository containts all the computations for my bachelor thesis. If you would like a copy of the thesis itself, just write me an email.

## Abstract
In this bachelor thesis, we present a numerical solution of the Schrödinger Equation for a gravitational potential `mgz` with parabolic boundary condition: `Ψ(φ, r, z) = 0` for `z = ar^2` . The Equation
was separated into three via coordinate transformations. The solutions were then found with the
shooting method. This result applies to an Ultra Cold Neutron in a parabolic container. Values
for the lowest energy states of such a Neutron have been calculated.
